# Quickstart
`npm install`

`npm run test`

You can lint with `npm run lint`.

# Notes
The basic structure of the program is a state machine and delegating frame scoring and finishing to classes.

The reason for mixing classes and more functional style is that state machines work a bit better with functional style programming. The classes allow for inhertiance for the scoring and finished frame functions. You can do this with just functional programming of course.

The commit time logs aren't accurate for all time spent programming, I took breaks.
